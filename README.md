# Image Recognition Model Project Using (AI)

# Project Idea:
Create an AI model that can recognize images and classify them into two categories:
- Fruits
- Vegetables
---
I used Teachable Machine, then tested the model using Python code in Google Colab.
---
# Tools Used:
- Teachable Machine
- TensorFlow (Keras Model)
- Python
- Google Colab
---
# Project Implementation Steps:
1. Collect images for each fruit and vegetable category
2. Train a model using Teachable Machine
3. Load the model in Keras format
4. Write Python code
5. Print the result and confidence score
6. Take a screenshot of the result
7. Upload all files to GitHub
